//! Issue #887: Loan Subordination and Cascading Debt Hierarchy
//!
//! This module implements a hierarchical debt structure where loans can be subordinated
//! (junior) to other loans (senior). It handles:
//! - Subordination relationships between loans
//! - Waterfall repayment distribution (senior loans repaid first)
//! - Cascading default logic (senior loan default affects subordinates)
//! - Subordination validation and loan dependency tracking
